## üåç **Project Overview**  
TradeWise is a platform to simplify cross border regulations, current approaches involve going through a huge amount of web portals scavenging hundreds of PDFs to discover knowledge about regulations and grants.

TradeWise uses Large Language Models and web scrapers to simplify all the process. TradeWise further proposes standard Export Compiance Services(ECS) 1.0 to help ease out the construction and improvement of future solutions of the same nature.

## ‚ú® **Features**  

### 1. Large Language Models(LLMs)
- **LLM powered chatbot** interactive chatbot that can be prompted by the user. This makes TradeWise more accessible to non technical users.
- **Huge data summarising** The model takes all the data obtained by web scrapers with some basic preprocessing and embeds it into it's parameters to give the appropriate output to user prompts

### 2. Standard ECS 1.0
- **Standard to compliance solutions** This standard provides guidelines for designing, structuring, and integrating cross-border regulation and incentive data to facilitate their usability by GenAI tools, web crawlers, and web portals.

### 3. Web Builder
- **Easy adoption of standard** Biggest issue with our standard is the technical skills required to implement it. Our web builder tool ensures that it becomes much easier to make endpoints adhering to ECS 1.0
